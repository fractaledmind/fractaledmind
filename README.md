## Hi there üëã


I‚Äôm Stephen. I am an American expat living in Berlin with my wife and 2 dogs‚ÄîTuck üê∂ and Ruby üêï (weirdly both emoji are pretty accurate depictions). I am someone who sweats the details, someone that would rather design in CodePen than Figma, someone who can learn both deeply and quickly because they aren't afraid to read obscure low-level source code or keep tabs on upcoming HTML, CSS, and JS features, and someone that enjoys sharing problems, solutions, tips and tricks with others.

### I'm a quick learner

At this point two years ago, I had never read or written a line of C, knew nearly nothing about SQLite, and had only contributed one small documentation fix to Rails core. Fast forward to today, I am now a <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/stephen-margheim/commits" class="underline">top-500 Rails core contributor</a>. I have written <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afractaledmind+is%3Aclosed">multiple PRs to the `sqlite3-ruby` gem (I'm now a top-5 contributor)</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/pull/463/files#diff-5a393d9872eb01d26891fb3583a9415dd3e4e5635964c82aee5263fde02ecde3">a few in C</a>. I have also now read large swathes of the SQLite C source code, and I am in the process of writing <a href="https://github.com/fractaledmind/feather">a lexer and parser for SQLite</a> by translating the entagled C code into Ruby. I am now <a href="https://x.com/levelsio/status/1763599554409079286?s=20">recognized</a> as one of the <em>the</em> experts in SQLite in the Ruby community.

Similarly, when I got my first job in tech after leaving graduate school in Classical Studies, I had never written a line of Ruby and knew nothing about Rails. Nonetheless, within 6 months of starting I was promoted from junior to mid-level Rails developer. In my second job, I was again promoted after 6 months in the role. This time, though, I was promoted to an engineering management role, and I have spent the last 4 years growing our team from 6 on-site, full-stack engineers maintaining one product to a department of 45+ remote engineers who have built and now maintain 4 products.

My key to learning new topics, tools, or technologies is to dive in head first and build something. I am a hands-on learner. Whether it is things for work or things I am simply interested in, I learn by doing. Being such a hands-on "manager-of-one" has granted me essentially all of my opportunities. I got into tech by building tools to be a more effective and efficient scholar. I got my first job from building Alfred workflows. And I now have a reputation in the Ruby community for my work on SQLite because I built various applications using SQLite and numerous tools on top of SQLite.

### I'm a minimalist perfectionist

I like to focus on leverage‚Äîhow you I produce the absolute best possible interface, component, DX with the absolute minimal bloat. I think of myself as a minimalist perfectionists.

I recently <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/full/KKEbmyG">tried to implement</a> the <a href="https://www.superlist.com">Superlist</a> inbox page in Tailwind CSS, which I could only do by eye as the source code is not available. I then spent the next two weeks before leaving for my wedding working to build a Rails clone using cutting-egde browser features (e.g. popovers and anchor positioning) and morphing. I streamed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuoosK264omOd8uszVOD0dzRfQc0uVJOK">the whole process</a>. It isn't perfect, I am still not satisfied with it, but I also didn't let that stop me from iterating, shipping, and sharing.

I also love to explore UX patterns to try and find an optimal balance between beauty, usability, and simplicity. As one example, I experimented with two different approaches to building a multiple file input in an edit form. In <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/mdGLpEz">one version</a>, I split the already saved files from the newly attached files and displayed them in two separate lists. In <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/MWqGKrp">the other</a>, I combined them into a single list but varied their styling. I believe that the second approach is more intuitive and user-friendly, but I am not sure. I would love to hear your thoughts. For one other example, I tried a few different approaches to an avatar component. I <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/qBQEaKj">started off</a> with a simple screen name text input that generates a deterministic avatar from <a href="https://boringavatars.com">Boring avatars</a>. I <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/poONzWG">then</a> tried using a generated avatar from <a href="https://avvvatars.com">avvvatars</a> along with a file upload button. <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/bGxBazW">Finally</a>, I allowed the user to choose if they wanted a shape or initial-based avatar or upload a custom image. Polish isn't simply how it looks statically, but how it works and feels to use.


### I want to delight

Where I am from in Louisiana, we have the concept of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagniappe">lagniappe</a></em>, or a little something extra. I want the things I build to have lagniappe. When I was exploring inline text editing, I wanted to keep things simple by simply stying regular form inputs to either look like static content or editable fields depending on focus, but I also wanted that transition between states to be delightful. I've experimented with both <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/dyepyVe">single line</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/yLjaLPO">multi-line</a> inputs, which each utilizing slight Tailwind animations. In fact, my very first larger project was <a href="https://codepen.io/smargh/pen/ZGNWmY">a CSS library</a> to provide a collection of icons that you could visually toggle between, like an up-chevron morphing into a down-chevron.

I will spend hours tweaking slides, even just for our company's bi-weekly Townhalls, where I have ended up incidentally defining much of the aesthetic of our slide deck. In the <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/12/23/rubyconftw/">slide deck</a> for my most recent conference talk, I spent days scouring the internet, working with GPTs, and experimenting in Sketch just to create this one image of a red ruby and a blue feather that I only use for a few seconds.
      
I also care deeply about the polish and delight in the code interfaces I build. I had been experimenting with <a href="https://tachyons.io">Tachyons</a> for a bit and liked atomic CSS, but I found their terse class names to be a bit too terse. I strive to strike a similar balance in the code that I write, especially that code that is meant to be consumed by other developers. I want my code to be a joy to use, delightful to read, and a pleasure to maintain.

Finally, I look to delight people through speaking and sharing. I will give talks at no less than <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">4 conferences</a> this year. I have also been a guest on <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/speaking/">various podcasts</a>, and I am <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/posts/">writing regularly</a> on various topics in web development. This year I also started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB-Ks14vr9bk4wgWX3xFnPA">Youtube channel</a> where I have done a two week sprint building the Superlist clone. When I look into the future of my career, I see myself continuing to share and teach, whether that be through speaking, writing, or mentoring.
